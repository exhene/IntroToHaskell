# IntroToHaskell

Haskell is a functional programming language that was developed in the late 1980s. It is named after the mathematician Haskell Curry and is designed to be purely functional, meaning that it does not have any side effects or mutable state.

Haskell is statically typed, meaning that the types of all variables and expressions are checked at compile time. It has a strong type system that allows for type inference, which means that the compiler can often determine the types of variables and expressions without requiring the programmer to explicitly specify them.

One of the key features of Haskell is its support for higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Haskell also has support for lazy evaluation, which means that expressions are only evaluated when their results are needed.

Haskell has a rich and expressive syntax, with features such as pattern matching and list comprehensions that make it easy to write concise and elegant code. It also has a large and active community of users and developers, and a wide range of libraries and tools that make it well-suited for a variety of applications.
